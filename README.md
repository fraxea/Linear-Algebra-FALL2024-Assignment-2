# Applications of Linear Algebra

In this repository, we design a series of notebooks to explore some applications of *Linear Algebra* in Machine Learning.

## Neural Network Intro

Some techniques like matrix operations and derivatives are the core in neural network architectures.

- Apply Linear Regression to predict the waiting time given the number of cars ahead of you in gas station.
- Get familiar with gradient descent, backpropagation, and other prerequisties of Neural Network.
- Implement RNN from scratch for Language Modeling on Harry Potter books.

## Word Embeddings

Representing words as vectors to maintain their meaning is a big idea. Some linear algebra based techniques were used to learn these word vectors (embeddings).

- Get familiar with GloVe. Evaluate word embeddings.
- Learn embeddings with SVD.
- Use these embeddings for sentiment analysis.

## Recommendation Systems

Matrix factorization is the key in recommenders based on SVD.

- Use SVD to apply collaborative filtering on movielens dataset.
